<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Ramesh</h1>

<p>
A passionate and dedicated developer from Nepal, currently pursuing a
<strong>Bachelor of Information Management (BIM)</strong> in the <strong>5th Semester</strong>.
I enjoy building clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications while continuously
learning and improving my technical skills.
</p>

<p>
My main interest lies in <strong>Full-Stack Development</strong>, where I work with both frontend
and backend technologies to create complete, functional applications.
I also have experience in <strong>mobile app development</strong> and actively practice
<strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python</strong> to strengthen my problem-solving skills.
</p>

<p>
I believe in consistent learning, writing clean and readable code, and building
real-world projects that help me grow as a developer.
